What is Git?
Git is a version control system. It helps developer to track and manage changes to their code over time. Its run locally on your machine  and you don’t need internet to use git itself

	1. Commit your works
	2. Go back to earlier version
	3. Work on new feature in branches without messing up the main code
	4. Collaborate with others without overwriting each other works.

Git -v / --version
Git -h / --help


echo "# git-commands" >> README.md

> Git add index.html
> Git commit -m "add index file"
